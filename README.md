# Chicken Weights Analysis
## Stage 1: EDA, Data Visualization and programming basics
In this report I worked with chickwts dataset it has two variables weight a numeric variable giving the chick weight and feed factor giving the feed type.<br />
This dataset is based on an experiment conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.<br />
This report focuses on the relationship between weight and food type and if a change in food type really affects chickens in any way.<br />
In this report I performed EDA and Data Visualization techniques.<br />
